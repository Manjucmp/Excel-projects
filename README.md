Title: Predictive Analytics Project: Restaurant Tips Prediction using Excel

Description:

As part of my coursework, I undertook a project focused on predictive analytics utilizing Microsoft Excel. The project involved analyzing a dataset titled "Restaurant tips dataset.xlsx" to predict tips provided by customers in a restaurant setting.

Key tasks undertaken:

Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values within the dataset to ensure data integrity.
Feature Analysis: Determined independent and dependent features within the dataset to understand the relationships between variables.
Predictive Problem Identification: Identified the predictive problem as a regression task, aiming to predict tip amounts based on various customer attributes.
Categorical Variable Encoding: Employed IF conditions to encode categorical variables into numeric values, enabling their utilization in the predictive model.
Model Building: Constructed an appropriate predictive model using Excel, leveraging the Data Analysis Add-in.
Performance Evaluation: Calculated the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the model to assess its predictive accuracy.


Model Deployment: Developed a predictive model capable of estimating tip amounts based on input values, providing a mathematical equation for tip prediction.
This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, feature analysis, predictive modeling, and performance evaluation using Excel. It also demonstrated my ability to apply analytical techniques to real-world datasets to derive actionable insights and facilitate decision-making processes.
